# awdx: The AWS DevOps X CLI Tool

## Why the Name "awdx"?
"awdx" stands for **AWS DevOps X** — where "X" means "for everything". This tool is designed to be your all-in-one command-line companion for AWS DevSecOps activities. The name is short, easy to type, and memorable, making it perfect for daily use by DevOps engineers.

## What is awdx?
awdx is a next-generation, human-friendly CLI tool that helps you manage, automate, and secure your AWS environment. It's built to be simple, interactive, and smart — giving you not just commands, but also helpful suggestions, best practices, and real-time feedback as you work.

## Vision
Our goal is to make awdx the most intuitive and powerful AWS DevSecOps CLI. We want you to:
- **Type less, do more:** Use natural, simple commands.

- **Automate securely:** Every action is checked for security and compliance.
- **Learn as you go:** awdx teaches you AWS and DevSecOps best practices interactively.
- **Talk to your CLI:** In the future, awdx will understand human language (AI/NLP), so you can type or even speak commands like "show me all public S3 buckets" or "rotate all IAM keys older than 90 days."
