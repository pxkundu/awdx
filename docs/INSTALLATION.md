# awdx Installation & Packaging Strategy

## Overview
awdx is designed to be a native, human-friendly AWS DevSecOps CLI tool. This document outlines how awdx will be packaged, distributed, and installed to ensure a seamless experience for all users, and how it will support future AI/NLP features.

---

## 1. Python Packaging for CLI
- **Language:** Python (easy to distribute, great for AI integration)
- **CLI Framework:** Typer (or Click)
- **Entry Point:** Console script defined in `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` so users can run `awdx` from any terminal.

---

## 2. Distribution Methods

### a. pip (Python Package Index)
- Standard Python package, installable with:
  ```
  pip install awdx
  ```
- Installs a native `awdx` command in the user's PATH.

### b. PyInstaller/pex/shiv (Single Binary)
- Bundle the app and dependencies into a single executable for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- No Python or pip required for end users.

### c. Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
- Homebrew formula for easy install:
  ```
  brew install awdx
  ```

### d. Linux Packages (deb/rpm)
- Optionally, package as `.deb` or `.rpm` for apt/yum-based systems.

## 3. Project Structure Example
```
awdx/
  awdx/                # Python package source
    __main__.py        # CLI entry point
    cli.py             # Typer/Click CLI logic
    ...
  tests/               # Unit tests
  pyproject.toml       # Modern Python packaging config
  setup.py             # (if using legacy setup)
  README.md
  LICENSE
  docs/                # Documentation
```

---

## 4. Console Script Entry Point

In `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[project.scripts]
awdx = "awdx.__main__:main"
```

Or in `setup.py`:
```python
entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
        'awdx=awdx.__main__:main',
    ],
},
```

---

## 5. User Experience
- After install, users simply type `awdx` in their terminal.
- CLI is available globally, just like `aws`, `kubectl`, or `docker`.

---

## 6. AI/NLP Integration (Future-Proofing)
- Design CLI to allow plugin modules (e.g., `awdx ai`).
- Integrate with LLM APIs (OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, etc.) for natural language support.
- Provide a `--ai` or `--chat` mode for conversational interaction.

---

## 7. Documentation & Help
- Include a `README.md` with install instructions.
- Provide `awdx --help` and rich CLI help for all commands.
- Optionally, publish docs on ReadTheDocs or GitHub Pages.

---

## 8. Continuous Delivery
- Use GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD to automate packaging, testing, and publishing to PyPI and other channels.
